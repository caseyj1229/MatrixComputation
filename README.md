# MatrixComputation
Reads in set of numbers from a text file, generates an n x n matrix from those numbers, and performs various matrix operations upon the given matrix, producing a variety of other matrices.  Operations performed include matrix addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, raising a matrix to an exponent, and transpose.

Input Text File works as follows:
First Number is the size of the n x n matrix
The next set of numbers are read in groups of three: first comes the row value, then the column value, and finally the cell value.
